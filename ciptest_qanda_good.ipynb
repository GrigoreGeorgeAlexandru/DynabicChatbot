The Internet of Things is a relatively new area\\nthat offers accessible but complex SE challenges that the authors\\nbelieve are an excellent example for inclusion in the educational\\nprocess.

I NTRODUCTION\\nSoftware engineering education (SEE) is an integrative set\\nof competencies that are part of the skill set of any profes-\\nsional software developer. Software engineering (SE) skills are\\nnecessary to ensure the quality of the resulting software and\\nto enable collaborative, planned, and effective development.\\nSeveral strategies have been developed to facilitate the acqui-\\nsition of these skills, and most involve a group application\\ndevelopment project. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly\\ngrowing paradigm for distributed systems. It is characterized\\nby a swarm of interconnected devices with low computational\\npower that focus on providing a limited number of func-\\ntions that improve an existing device and generally provide\\ndata that enables better decision making. In both academic\\nand industrial initiatives, a variety of device architectures\\nand protocols make for a highly heterogeneous environment.\\nThe lack of a ”clear path forward” can be challenging for\\ndevelopers tasked with finding the best solutions to specific\\nproblems.
